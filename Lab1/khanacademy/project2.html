        <h1>Travel to USA</h1>
        <img src="https://ce.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Flag_of_the_United_States_%281912-1959%29.svg">
        <ol>You can see:
            <li id="first"> Tropical and Islan vibes
            <li id="second"> Otherworldly Desert Landscapes
            <li id="third"> Fantasy-Like Landscapes
            
            
        </ol>
        <p class="mini"> The USA has a lot of unexpectedly exotic places—some feel tropical, others feel like another planet</p>
        <p class="maxi"> The United States is a vast and diverse country, known for its mix of cultures, landscapes, and opportunities. From modern cities and technological innovation to national parks, deserts, forests, and tropical islands, the USA offers experiences found almost nowhere else in one nation. Its diversity, freedom of expression, and constant movement make it a place of contrast and possibility.
